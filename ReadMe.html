    Visualization of Trump approval	ratings	starting on the	first day of his presidency. 
    </h1>
    <p>
    The Obama administration approval for the same period within their administration is shown for comparison.
</p>
    <p>
        Data are collected from the <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/">Rasmussen Report</a> and can be downloaded <a href="http://www.rasmuss\
enreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/trump_approval_index_history"> here for Trump</a> and <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/o\
bama_administration/obama_approval_index_history"> here	for the	Obama administration</a>. Originally downloaded	on March 18 2017.
<p>
    The <a href="index.html">visualization</a> shows the <i>Total approval</i> rating as y-value on	the top	panel, with color code corresponding to	percentage of people <i>Strongly approving</i> the presidency, and 
vice-versa, y-value percentage shows <i>Strong approval</i> color coded by	<i>Total</i> approval in the bottom panel.
</p>
<p>
Noticebly, the Total approval rating was higher	for Obama throughout, but the Strong approval percentage is comparable.	
</p>
<p>
Rolling	over the values	for the	Trump administration in	the top	panel shows events that	occurred in that day, and in the revious days if polling does not exist	for those dates. Of
 course	any causal connection should be	made carefully, and a time lag of a few days between events and approval response should be assumed.
